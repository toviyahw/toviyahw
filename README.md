## {About Me}
As a senior studying data science, I am driven by a deep curiosity to uncover the stories hidden within data. I enjoy solving problems, exploring patterns, and transforming raw information into actionable insights. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve gathered skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, database creation, and programming. These are skills which I aim to refine and expand upon through a series of personal projects documented here! Outside of academics, I spend my time playing tennis and reading books about other worlds!
